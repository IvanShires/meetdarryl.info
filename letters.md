  <b>From: Mollie</b> As a student at Western who you use to live in one of the furthest away residents halls; riding a CatTran driven by Darryl was not only a blessing, but also enjoyable. He would always play the best music, always make funny comments under his breathe and always the make the ride a party. Best of wishes, prayers for a speedy recovery and hope to see him again soon.
