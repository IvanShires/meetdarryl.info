This page is dedicated to individuals sending in their Get Well Soon notes, along with a space for people to share their stories. "Get Well Soon" notes, and stories can be submitted by sending them to **<shiresivan@gmail.com>**. I will do my best to add them as quickly as they come in.

  <b>From: Ivan</b> I've only known Darryl at the time he's been with Cat Tran, but he has always had an amazing personality, loving of all people, and eager to be the highlight of someone's day. I can't wait for him to come back to work.
