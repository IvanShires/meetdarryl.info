Welcome to MeetDarryl, this is a website put together to give updates on how Darryl is doing, to share stories about the people he’s touched, and to gather community support to help Darryl and his family through this difficult time.

Darryl has lived in Cullowhee for the past two years, quickly being a loved member of the Cat Tran service serving the Western Carolina University campus. Appreciated by both students and staff alike, Darryl touched many hearts in his time working and supporting him through this fight is the best way for us to get him back sooner.

If you have any stories about Darryl, please reach out to me at **<shiresivan@gmail.com>** and I will do my best to add stories in as updates comes in on how Darryl’s condition improves.

Be sure to send good wishes, please tell your friends, family and fellow community members!
