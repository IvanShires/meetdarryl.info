Welcome to Darryl's Website, this is a place for us all to #MeetDarryl. This website is a space for us to give updates on his improvement, gather community support, and most importantly - some of the stories from the people he's touched over the years. If you would like to show support by donating to help with his expenses, we've setup a GoFundMe that you may access by clicking [here](https://gofund.me/78deee7d).

Darryl has lived in Cullowhee for the past two years, quickly being a loved member of the Cat Tran service serving the Western Carolina University campus. Appreciated by both students and staff alike, Darryl touched many hearts in his time working and supporting him through this fight is the best way for us to get him back sooner.

If you have any stories about Darryl, please reach out to me at **<shiresivan@gmail.com>** and I will do my best to add stories, as well as giving updates as Darrylâ€™s condition improves.

Be sure to send good wishes, please tell your friends, family and fellow community members!
