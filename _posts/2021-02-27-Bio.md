Those of us who know Darry Robinson as a friend, coworker, or family member appreciate every one of you who has taken the time out of your day to show support and consider the difficult situation Darryl is currently in. Throughout his life, Darryl has been a kind gentleman who has known and overcome adversity. The kindness you continue to show, either in the comments, the support throughout the community, and the contributions you've made to him have lifted Darryl's spirits as he faces this arduous mile in his journey.

Several years ago, Darryl left everything he once knew in Florida, his family, business, and friends - to care for his godmother. His godmother currently lives in the Cullowhee area after caring for Darryl in his youth. With the comings of advanced age, Darryl saw the need to come to assist her. While not helping her, Darryl worked for Western Carolina University (WCU) part-time as a bus driver.
In his youth, Darryl lived-in inner-city project housing. Surrounded by crime and violence, Darryl saw past those harsh realities, seeing potential himself, and was determined to create a better life for himself despite the odds stacked against him. After working long hours at low-paying jobs, Darryl would go on to open his limousine service. Also, Darryl would work as a school bus driver and school security officer to support his growing family. He is a father â€“ and now a grandfather. Darryl does not only show deep care for his family members - but every person Darryl comes in contact with can feel his nurturing and uplifting spirit. Darryl is known as a WCU Cat-Tran driver, boasts about his cheerful spirit, and finds humor in his love for music.

In the spring semester of 2020, Darryl started experiencing some health problems. When he noticed his health declining, he still dedicated his time to work. His health got so bad that he found himself not being able to make it through his entire shift. In the Fall of 2020, he was diagnosed with cancer that required chemotherapy. He is now undergoing these treatments. Darryl would like nothing more than to return to work and bringing smiles to his coworkers, friends, and student's faces. However, with his state, he is unable to work and has now exhausted his savings, and he needs the continued help and support of our community.

Darryl is strongly spirited in his religious beliefs. He uses this strong spirit to live his life in a song of thankfulness and gratitude. Darryl has always maintained kindness and compassion for all, no matter their situation or background. He has handled every adversity that has been thrown his way and has helped many others through their hardships. Darryl would give the shirt off his back to anyone with no questions asked - why don't you say as a community we continue to help him back? Through support, compassion, monetary contribution, and love, we can help Darryl continue his passionate path of nurturing and compassion for others. Thank you all so much again for your willingness to contribute and offer your help to this honest, hard-working, caring, and sweet man; if you know Darryl, you know this support from his community makes him smile from to ear.
